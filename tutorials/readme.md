this folder contains tutorial notebooks to be used offline (outside colab)
and are the identical copies to the colab notebooks without the 'plain' prefix.

we recommend using the supplied conda env

``conda env create -f environment.yml``

this will create an environment named episol_tutorial
Once your env is created select this as your kernel to use for the notebooks
